# SYCOPHANCY.md

**Sycophancy and bias prevention protocol for AI agents — enforce honest disagreement and citations.**

SYCOPHANCY.md is a plain-text Markdown file you place in the root of any AI agent project. It defines sycophantic patterns (agreement without evidence, opinion reversal on pushback, excessive affirmation), prevention rules (require citations for factual claims, challenge without new evidence, permit respectful correction), detection methods, response protocols, and audit logging — so your agent stays honest under pressure and disagreement is not a failure mode.

## The AI Agent Safety Stack

SYCOPHANCY.md is part of a twelve-file open standard for AI agent safety, quality, and accountability:

### Operational Control

## Why This Exists

AI agents spend money, send messages, modify files, and call external APIs — often autonomously. Regulations are catching up:

- **EU AI Act** (August 2026) — mandates human oversight and shutdown capabilities
- **Colorado AI Act** (June 2026) — requires impact assessments and transparency
- **US state laws** — California, Texas, Illinois and others have active AI governance requirements

These specifications give you a standardised, auditable record of your agent's safety boundaries.
